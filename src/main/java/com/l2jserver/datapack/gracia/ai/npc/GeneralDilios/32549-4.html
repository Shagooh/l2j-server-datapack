Fighting in the Seed of Destruction between the adventurers of Keucereus' clan and the Mounted Troop is at its peak. According to our scouts' reports, it is completely surrounded by the Mounted Troop; entry is impossible at the moment.<br>
Perhaps if you wait nearby until the battle ends... But of course nobody knows which side will prevail. <br>
